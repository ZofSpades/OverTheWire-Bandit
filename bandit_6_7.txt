cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
password: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

cmdit: ls -al
There is nothing here to take note of.

cmdit: cd ..
This moves to previous directory.
Here we can see many directories to be present.

Since we know the user and group owner along with the file size, we can directly find for it.
cmdit: find . / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
We got many files with denied access and the path to the file where the password for next level of bandit is.
We could just scroll looking for it or better tweak the cmd to do the same.

cmdit:  find . / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null
So in this cmd, we added somethinng extra, i.e., 2> /dev/null
    2> -> the number 2 basically signifies std. error or error meassages (0 for input and 1 for std. output).
          and '>' redirects to the specified location
    /dev/null -> this discards anythinng written to it, basically like a black-hole
                 Reference: https://linuxhint.com/what_is_dev_null/?source=post_page-----9a57d2403839---------------------------------------

The above cmd gives to path to the file where password could be stored.

cmdit:  cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
This gives you password for bandit7
