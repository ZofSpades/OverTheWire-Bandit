cmdit: cat cronjob_bandit23
cmdit: cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
Here, in the script, 'myname' is actually bandit23.
To get 'mytarget', we need to execute the line said in the script

cmdit: echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
We get a line, this is mytarget

Since the next line says that /tmp/$mytarget is getting saved or copied to bandit23 in 'etc' directory, this is the password
cmdit: cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
When you execute this, we get the password for next bandit.
