Continue from Bandit 15 to 16

cmdit: nmap -p 31000-32000 --script sll-cert localhost
This scans all your ports on locahost machine for open ports along with ssl certificate.
This reduces time to check each port for ssl certificate too.
We get 2 such ports.

cmdit:  openssl s_client -connect localhost:31518 --quiet
Here '--quiet' is used to remove unneccessary data which is not needed for us, hence clean terminal.
After hitting enter, paste the previous bandit password, and hit enter.
We get the same text what we entered, so this is not the right port.

cmdit:  openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 --quiet
Do the same as before, now we get a  private RSA key as the output.
Copy this

cmdit: mkdir /tmp/spam
We need to store this private RSA key in a file to connect to bandit17, so we are making a new directory

cmdit: cd /tmp/spam
cmdit: nano sec_key
'nano' is a text editor where you can edit texts in terminal itself.
Paste the key you copied before here and save it.

cmdit: chmod 400 sec_key
We are changing the file permission to read-only, so that there wouldn't be any tampering with it and ssh only uses these types of files.

cmdit:  ssh -i sec_key -p 2220 bandit17@localhost
We are now logged in to bandit17 system.

cmdit: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
This gives us the password for Bandit17
This step is actually not required since we have been using different machine inside the different machine inside the diff- (ok, i'll stop :))
