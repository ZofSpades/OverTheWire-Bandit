cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

Tip: Read the reference below before starting this challenge

cmdit: ls
cmdit: cat sshkey.private
You will see that a private RSA key is stored in it.
Now we need to connect to bandit14 to get the password for next bandit.

cmdit:  ssh -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@localhost
Here we are connecting to another remote machine using ssh.
"ssh.private" file is private RSA key needed to authenticate for connection.
And if we don't use the port number 2220, 22 will be used as default, again to which we wouldn't be able to connect.

cmdit: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
This prints the password needed for bandit14
