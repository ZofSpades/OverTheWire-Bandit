cmdit: ls -a
cmdit: cd repo
cmdit: ls -a
cmdit: cat README.md
Here we see, '<no passwords in production!>'
This hints us that password might be in any other branch.

cmdit: git branch -a
Here we see that there are 3 branches apart from HEAD/master
Lets check each one until we get the password

cmdit: git checkout remotes/origin/dev
cmdit:ls -a
cmdit: cat README.md
This gives us password for next bandit
