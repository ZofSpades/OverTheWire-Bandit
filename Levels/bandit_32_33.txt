There is bit more explanation to this, so just google about it.
In short, we are opening current working shell inside teh current working shell (goods crazy right?!)

cmdit: ls -al
Here we can see that there is a file with bandit33 as owner

cmdit: cat uppershell
This is gibberish

cmdit: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
