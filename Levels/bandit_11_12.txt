cmdit: ls
cmdit: cat data.txt
We can see a ROT13 encoding which is bascially shifting the particular letter by it's next 13th letter.
If we decode this, we will get password for next bandit

cmdit: cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
Here "tr" basically means translate, so we are saying that 'A' is 'N' (the 13th letter after A is N) and so on for both upper and lower case.
So, this cmd decodes and gives password for bandit12
