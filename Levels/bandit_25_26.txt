cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
password: iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4

cmdit: ls
cmdit: cat bandit26.sshkey
cmdit: ssh -i bandit26.sshkey -p 2220 bandit26@localhost
It shows that we got connected, but got logged out as soon as we logged in.

I came to know that, since all these machines or users are interconnected, we can see the shell each user are using.

cmdit: cat /etc/passwd
This shows each user's shell.
Here we can be that in bandit26, instead of /bin/bash, there is /usr/bin/showtext

cmdit: cat /usr/bin/showtext
Here we can see that a .txt file is being executed which may or maynot print the content while logging to bandit26.
But we also see 'more' word here.
The speciality of 'more' is that when text or file content is show on terminal, if the content is more or big that terminal, it goes to interactive mode.
You can try to use 'man' for nay cmd and check that, if teh terminal is small, we have to scroll manually to look further.
This is what we gonna try now.

Resize your terminal, smaller than the login content 

cmdit: ssh -i bandit26.sshkey -p 2220 bandit26@localhost

Now we that it has entered interactive mode, and we are able to scroll, but dont actually scroll, because you will be logged out again.

Now hold the letter v to access vim editor(I need to learn more on vim, since I just use nano. So I wouldn't be explain complex stuff like how actually it is working for now)

cmdit: :set shell=/bin/bash
cmdit: :shell
Now we can see than bandit26 is the user right now.

cmdit: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
This gives you password for next bandit.
