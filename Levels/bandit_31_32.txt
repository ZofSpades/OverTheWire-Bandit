Here we are asked to push a file to remote repo

cmdit: cat .gitignore
Here we see that there is '*.txt' file.
This file doesn't let any file with '.txt' to be considered as part of repo, so we need to remove this file

cmdit: rm .gitignore

Now, lets make the file

cmdit: echo "May I come in?" > key.txt

Now lets add this file, and make a commit before pushing the file

cmdit: git add .
cmdit: git commit -m "added key.txt"
cmdit: git push origin master
This gives us password for next bandit
