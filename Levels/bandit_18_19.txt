Byebye!

Here we are getting logout beacuse, .bashrc in it, has been changed to do this so.

cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org cat .bashrc
password: <you enter>
Here we see that, at the end of the .bashrc file, there is a line called "exit 0".
This line is causing the bash terminal to exit each time we try to login.
To solve this, we need to try to access different type of terminal after login instead of bash, to bypass .bashrc

cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -t /bin/sh
password: <you enter>
This time we have successfully bypassed .bashrc and we logged in.
This is because we used pseudo terminal 'sh', i.e., the primitive version of bash.
So, .bashrc is not being called at all, and we are directly accessing 'sh' terminal.

cmdit: ls
cmdit: cat readme
This gives you password for bandit19
