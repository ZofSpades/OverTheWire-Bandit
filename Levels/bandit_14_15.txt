Continue this challenge from Bandit level 13 to 14

cmdit: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
Copy the password of previous challenge

cmdit: nc localhost 30000
After writing this and clicking enter, it waits for you to give some input.
And the input you have to enter is the copied password of the previous challenge.
When you enter the correct password, and hit enter, it prints the password for next Bandit.

Here what "nc" does is, it makes TCP connection between your working terminal and the localhost (since we mentioned it in cmdit) on port 30000.
We can even use 'nc' cmd to connect to other machines using the same way (nc <machine> <port>)
