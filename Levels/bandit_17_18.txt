cmdit: ssh -p 2220 bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
password: EReVavePLFHtFlFsjn3hyzMlvSuSAcRD

cmdit: ls -al
cmdit: diff passwords.new passwords.old
This cmd prints which unique line is changed to what(since the rest remains the same).
Since I mentioned .new first and then .old, the first text which is printed on the terminal belongs to .new file and is the password for bandit18
