cmdit: find . -exec file -i {} + | grep 'text/plain'
This cmd, we can break into parts:
    find . -> this recuresively searches from the current directory
    -exec -> executes cmd after going to files and folders
    file -i {} + -> this dertermines the file type
    grep 'text/plain' -> this filters annd display only text/plain type of files
When this cmd is executed we get ./-file07

cmdit: cat ./-file07
This is will give you password for bandit5
